## Overview
The React Starter Kit offers neccesary and helpful packages and dependency for getting started with your next React project.
It comes with React-Router, Axios, Material-UI, Styled Components, and more for quickly starting a project with minimal setup. Along with packages it comes configured with ESlint, Jest, Enzyme for linting, unit & integration testing, and debugging. Helping to catch errors before build time and ensure code is performant. For easy component development Storybook and Bit are implemented to make constructing compenents simpler and easy to share with developers. As well as continious integration with Circle CI so when you deploy changes they're automically integrated with production code. This is coupled with steps on how to deploy to Google Cloud's App Engine with integration with your repo and Circle CI. 

## Getting Started


### Dependencies
List of packages/dependencies included in kit.

* Material-UI - CSS library based on Google's Material Design for React
* React-Spring - Physic Based Animation Library for React
* React-Router - Naviagation based package for React & React Native
* Axios - Promise based data fetching API
* Storybook - Isolated enviroment for developing React components
* Bit - Cloud based service for sharing and uploading components
* Jest - Facebbok made Javascript testing framework
* Enzyme - React focused testing framework built by Air B&B

### Create React App
Create React apps with no build configuration.

### Component Development

#### Storybook
Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

#### Bit
Bit creates a faster, distributed workflow for developing components from different repositories. Using Bit you can import components into any repository for further development, even if they're installed with NPM. Changes can then be synced across projects with smart updates and cross-repo component change merges.

### UI/UX Design

#### React-Router
Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!
#### React-Spring
A set of spring-physics based primitives (as in building blocks) that should cover most of your UI related animation needs once plain CSS can't cope any longer. Forget easings, durations, timeouts and so on as you fluidly move data from one state to another. This isn't meant to solve each and every problem but rather to give you tools flexible enough to confidently cast ideas into moving interfaces.
#### React-Transition
#### Material-UI
React components that implement Google's Material Design.
### Data Fetching

#### Axios
Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

#### Apollo
Apollo Client is the best way to use GraphQL to build client applications. The client is designed to help you quickly build a UI that fetches data with GraphQL, and can be used with any JavaScript front-end.

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Auth0
We provide a universal authentication & authorization platform for web, mobile, and legacy applications.

### Testing & Debugging

#### Jest
Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases.

#### Enzyme
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

Enzyme's API is meant to be intuitive and flexible by mimicking jQuery's API for DOM manipulation and traversal.

### Continious Development/Integraion

#### CircleCI
CircleCI gives your team more speed and configurability than ever before. Automate your pipeline from commit to deploy

#### Docker
Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

#### Cloud Build
A fully managed continuous integration, delivery, & deployment platform that lets you build, test, and deploy in the cloud. Focus on coding by running fast
